My solutions to selected problems of Querying and Modifying relations

Disclaimer:
The exercises presented in this repo are taken from the Stanford Lagunita's Database's course, given by Professor Jennifer Widom. 
Despite this being a public repo my goal is not to facilitate an easy walkthrough of some of the exercises. If you are an attendee of the course I encourage you to only look at my submissions here after coming up with your own solution.

Relational Algebra (RA) is a formal language which  SQL and other database softwares.

The following exercises illustrate the use of RA operators in the RA Workbench maintained by Professor Jun Yang.

Relations used in the exercises (Link: https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/DB/RA/asset/pizzadata.html )

    Person(name, age, gender)       // name is a key
    Frequents(name, pizzeria)       // [name,pizzeria] is a key
    Eats(name, pizza)               // [name,pizza] is a key
    Serves(pizzeria, pizza, price)  // [pizzeria,pizza] is a key
    
Q1 Find all pizzas eaten by at least one female over the age of 20. 

\project_{pizza} (
    (\select_{gender='female' and age >=20} Person)
    \join
    Eats)

Q5 Find the names of all people who eat at least one pizza served by Dominos but who do not frequent Dominos.

 \project_{name} (
         ((\project_{name} Frequents)
         \diff
         (\project_{name} \select_{pizzeria = 'Dominos'} Frequents)) 
    \join 
         (\select_{pizzeria='Dominos'} Serves
         \join Eats))
         
Q8 Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30. 

\project_{pizzeria} (
         Frequents \join (
            \select_{age>30} Person)) 
            \diff \project_{pizzeria}(\project_{pizza}(\select_{age<30} Person \join Eats) 
            \diff \project_{pizza}(\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats)\join Serves)
         
Q9 Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30. 

\project_{pizzeria} Serves \diff
    \project_{pizzeria} (
            (\project_{pizza}(\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats)
                \cross
            (\project_{pizzeria} Serves))
        \diff
            (\project_{pizza, pizzeria}((\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats) \join Serves)))
